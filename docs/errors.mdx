description: "The status codes and error format for Spot's API"
---

Successful requests will return a `200 - OK` HTTP status code. If the request fails, the response will contain a key
`error` on the top level, and a 4XX or 5XX HTTP status code. Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following
format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "type": "bad_request",
    "detail": "first_name: Field is required"
  }
}
```
The error type will be one of `bad_request`, `not_found`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `rate_limit_exceeded`, `server_error`.

A full list of returned status codes can be found below:

| Status Code                          | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200 - OK`                           | Everything worked as expected.                                                                              |
| `400 - Bad Request`                  | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                                    |
| `401 - Unauthorized`                 | No valid API key provided.                                                                                  |
| `403 - Forbidden`                    | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                                |
| `404 - Not Found`                    | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                                       |
| `429 - Too Many Requests`            | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We currently don't rate limit requests, but we may do in future. |
| `500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors` | Something went wrong on our end. This is rare.                                                              |
