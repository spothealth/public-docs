During onboarding, each your team members will be supplied their own API key. This key should be supplied in the header
under the `Authorization` key for each request. Unauthenticated requests, or those with an invalid API key, will be
rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` response. The API key should be prefixed with `Token` and a space to identify it
as an API token. For example:

```
{
  "Authorization": "Token API_KEY_HERE"
}
```
