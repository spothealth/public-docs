title: "Generate registration token"
openapi: "POST /api/v2/tokens/patient_registration/"

<Tip>
  This endpoint is only needed if you want to use your own authentication system to manage kit registration. It's
  not needed in most cases. Speak to us if you want to build your registration flow this way.
</Tip>

This endpoint generates a one-time-use token that can be passed to your kit registration page to allow for a more
convenient registration process for repeat patients. This token is patient-specific. “patient_id” is Spot’s unique
identifier for a patient. It is returned by any of our api endpoints that supply patient information, such as
sample and order retrieval.
